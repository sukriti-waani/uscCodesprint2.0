/*      Trapping Rain Water
You are given an array of non-negative integers where each element represents the height of a bar at that position. Imagine vertical bars of unit width placed next to each other â€” after it rains, water is trapped between some of the bars. Your task is to compute how much water can be trapped between the bars.
Write a function to return the total units of trapped water.

Example
Input:
height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output:
6
Explanation:
Water is trapped in the dips between bars.

Total water trapped = 6 units.

Constraints:
1 <= height.length <= 10^5
0 <= height[i] <= 10^4
