/*             Minimize the maximum sum of any group
You are given n boxes with weights, stored in an array. Your task is to divide them into at most k contiguous groups. Each group must have consecutive elements only, and your goal is to minimize the weight of the heaviest group after the division.
Write a program to find and print the minimum possible maximum group sum.

Example:
Input:
Enter number of elements: 5
Enter number of groups: 3
Enter weights:
1 2 3 4 5
What are we solving?
We want to split [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] into at most 3 contiguous groups such that the largest sum among any group is as small as possible.

Try all possible splits with 3 groups:
[1] [2] [3 4 5] â†’ group sums = 1, 2, 12 â†’ max = 12
[1 2] [3 4] [5] â†’ group sums = 3, 7, 5 â†’ max = 7
[1 2 3] [4] [5] â†’ group sums = 6, 4, 5 â†’ max = 6
[1 2 3 4] [5] (only 2 groups) â†’ group sums = 10, 5 â†’ max = 10
[1 2] [3] [4 5] â†’ group sums = 3, 3, 9 â†’ max = 9
[1] [2 3] [4 5] â†’ group sums = 1, 5, 9 â†’ max = 9
Best split: [1 2 3], [4], [5] â†’ max sum = 6
ðŸ§¾ Final Output:
Minimum possible maximum group sum is: 6
