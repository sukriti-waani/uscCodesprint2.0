/*  Exam Seating Arrangement - Checkerboard Pattern
You are given a square hall with n Ã— n seats. Students can only be seated at positions where the sum of the row and column indices is even (i.e., (i + j) % 2 == 0).

1 represents a student seated,
0 represents an empty seat.
Count and print the total number of students seated.
