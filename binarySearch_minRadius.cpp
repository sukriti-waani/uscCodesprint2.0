/*        Heaters and Minimum Radius
You are given the positions of houses and heaters on a 1D line. All the houses can only be warmed by heaters within a certain radius.
Each heater warms every house within its radius on both sides (i.e., from heater - radius to heater + radius).
Your task is to find the minimum radius required so that every house is within the warming range of at least one heater.

Input Format:
First line: Integer n â€“ number of houses
Second line: n space-separated integers â€“ positions of the houses
Third line: Integer m â€“ number of heaters
Fourth line: m space-separated integers â€“ positions of the heaters
Output Format:
A single integer â€“ the minimum radius required for the heaters

ðŸ’¡ Constraints:
1 â‰¤ n, m â‰¤ 10^5
House and heater positions are integers in the range [1, 10^9]
The positions of houses and heaters may not be sorted

Example 1:
Input:
3
1 2 3
1
2
Output:
1
Explanation:
Heater is at position 2.
House 1 is 1 unit away â†’ needs radius â‰¥ 1
House 2 is 0 units away â†’ already covered
House 3 is 1 unit away â†’ needs radius â‰¥ 1
So the minimum radius = 1

Example 2:
Input:
2
1 5
1
2
Output:
3
Explanation:
Heater is at position 2.
House 1 is 1 unit away â†’ OK
House 5 is 3 units away â†’ So radius must be â‰¥ 3
Hence, minimum radius = 3
