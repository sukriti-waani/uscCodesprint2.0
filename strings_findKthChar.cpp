/*                Find the k-th Character in a Special Doubling String
You are given an integer k.
Consider a string-building process that starts with:
s = "a"
At each step, the string doubles in size by appending a transformed copy:
s = s + transform(s)
where transform(s) means each character of s is replaced by its next character in the English alphabet (with 'z' wrapping around to 'a').

For example:
Step 0: s = a
Step 1: s = a + b = ab
Step 2: s = ab + bc = abbc
Step 3: s = abbc + bccd = abbcbccd
... and so on.
Your task is to find the character at position k (1-based index) in this infinite process, without generating the entire string.

Input
An integer k (1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 10^9) â€” the position of the character you want to find.
Output
Output the character at the k-th position.

Example
5
Output:
b
ðŸ’¡ Explanation
The string grows as:
Step 0: s = a               â†’ length 1
Step 1: s = ab              â†’ length 2
Step 2: s = abbc            â†’ length 4
Step 3: s = abbcbccd        â†’ length 8
...
The 5th character corresponds to the 1st character of the transformed part of the length-4 string, so it is 'b'.
